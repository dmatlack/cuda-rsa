       pprriimmeeggaappss  searches for large gaps in the sequence of primes.  The gaps
       between 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on are 1, 2, 2, 4, and so on.

       When pprriimmeeggaappss sees a new largest gap _n, from _p--_n to  _p,  it  prints  a
       line  _p  _n  _r where _r is the approximate ratio between the log of _n and
       the log of the log of _p.
